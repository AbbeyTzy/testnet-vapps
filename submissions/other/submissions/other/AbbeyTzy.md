## Category
other

## Description
This vApp enables a decentralized feedback and rewards system for online communities.  
Users can submit contributions, feedback, or content and receive verifiable reputation points or rewards using Soundness Layer zkProofs.  
The system encourages quality engagement while maintaining privacy and transparency.

## Technical Architecture
- Contributions and feedback are submitted via a web interface or Discord bot.  
- Data hashed and verified with **Soundness CLI**.  
- zkProofs generated for each valid contribution.  
- Points/rewards calculated off-chain and proofs verified on Soundness Layer.  
- Future extension: gamification system with leaderboards and badges.

## Timeline
- **Week 1:** Setup repo & basic Soundness CLI integration  
- **Week 2:** Implement contribution submission and proof generation  
- **Week 3:** MVP: reward calculation + testnet deployment  
- **Week 4:** Dashboard and leaderboards for community feedback
